| <p>Testing is tedious! At least that's what I thought before I stumbled over **property-based testing** ‚Äì a simple approach that allows you to write fewer tests yet gain more confidence in your code.</p><p>In traditional testing, you define concrete inputs and test whether they result in the desired output. In property based testing, you define certain conditions that are always true for any input (those are called *properties*). In mathematics, there's the ‚àÄ operator for that.

Here are some benefits:

- ‚ö° **Write fewer tests.** Let Glados figure out inputs that break your invariants.
- üåå **Test for all possible inputs.** Well, not literally all. But a huge variety.
- üêú **Get a concise error report.** Glados simplifies inputs that break your tests.
- ü§Ø **Understand the problem domain better** by thinking of invariants.

## Quickstart

```yml
dev_dependencies:
  test: ...
  glados: ...
```

Use `Glados<...>().test(...)` instead of the traditional `test(...)`.

```dart
// Running this test shows you that it fails for the input 21.
Glados<int>().test((a) {
  expect(a * 2, lessThan(42));
});
```

You can test with multiple inputs.

```dart
Glados2<String, int>().test((a, b) { ... });
```

Instead of using type parameters, you can customize inputs using `any`.

```dart
Glados(any.lowercaseLetter).test((letter) { ... });
Glados(any.nonEmptyList(any.positiveIntOrZero)).test((list) { ... });
```

You want to test with your own data classes? [Here's how to write generators.](#how-to-write-generators).

You can also [customize the size of the generated inputs](#customizing-the-exploration-phase).

## Comprehensive example

Suppose you write a function that tries to find the maximum in a list.
I know ‚Äì that's pretty basic ‚Äì but it's enough to get you started.
Here's an obviously wrong implementation:

```dart
/// If the list is empty, return null, otherwise the biggest item.
int max(List<int> input) => null;
```

To be sure that the function does the right thing, you might want to write some tests.
Here's how those would look like in traditional unit testing:

```dart
test('maximum of empty list', () {
  expect(max([]), equals(null));
});
test('maximum of non-empty list', () {
  expect(max([40, 2, 10]), equals(40));
});
```

> Not familiar with the syntax of the [`test`](https://pub.dev/packages/test) package? [Here are the docs](https://pub.dev/packages/test).

Executing `pub run test path/to/tests.dart` should show that the second test fails.

In property-based testing, you look for invariants ‚Äì conditions that should be true for any input.
For example, if `max` produces `null`, the list should be empty:

```dart
Glados<List<int>>().test('maximum is only null if the list is empty', (list) {
  if (max(list) == null) {
    expect(list, isEmpty);
  }
});
```

Just create a `Glados` instance and call its `test` method instead of using the normal `test` function.
`Glados` takes a generic type parameter ‚Äì in this case, `List<int>`.
It then tests your code with a variety of inputs of that type.
All of them need to succeed for the whole test to succeed.

Running the test should produce something like this:

```txt
Tested 1 input, shrunk 25 times.
Failing for input: [0]
...
```

Glados discovered that a list with some content breaks the condition!

Let's modify our `max` function to pass this test:

```dart
int max(List<int> input) => 42;
```

We need to add another invariant to reject this function as well.
Arguably the most obvious invariant for `max` is the following: The maximum should be greater than or equal to all items of the list:

```dart
Glados(any.nonEmptyList(any.int)).test('maximum is >= all items', (list) {
  var maximum = max(list);
  for (var item in list) {
    expect(maximum, greaterThanOrEqualTo(item));
  }
});
```

Instead of defining type parameters, you can also pass in *generators* to Glados to customize which values are generated.
You can find all available generators as fields on the `any` value.
In this case, we only test with non-empty lists because we handled the empty list in the first test.

Running the tests produces the following result:

```txt
Tested 35 inputs, shrunk 117 times.
Failing for input: [43]
...
```

Glados detected that the invariant breaks if the input list contains a `43`.

Let's actually add a more reasonable implementation for `max`:

```dart
int max(List<int> input) {
  if (input.isEmpty) {
    return null;
  }
  var max = 0;
  for (var item in input) {
    if (item > max) {
      max = item;
    }
  }
  return max;
}
```

This fixes the tests, but still doesn't work for lists containing only negative values.
So, let's add a final test:

```dart
Glados(any.nonEmptyList(any.int)).test('maximum is in the list', (list) {
  expect(list, contains(max(list)));
});
```

I'll leave implementing the function correctly to you, the reader.

But whatever solution you come up with, it'll be correct:
Our tests aren't merely some arbitrary examples anymore.
Rather, they correspond to the **actual mathematical definition of max**.

## How does it work?

Glados works in two phases:

- üåç **The exploration phase**: Glados generates increasingly complex, random inputs until one breaks the invariant or the maximum number of runs is reached.
- üêú **The shrinking phase**: This phase only happens if Glados found an input that breaks the invariant. In this case, the input is gradually simplified and the smallest input that's still breaking the invariant is returned.

Generators are responsible for generating code. `Generator<T>` is simply a function that takes a `random` and `size` and produces a `Shrinkable<T>`.
The `random` parameter should be used as the only source of randomness to guarantee reproducibility when running tests multiple times.
The `size` parameter is used as a rough estimate on how big or complex the returned value should be.
For example, the generator for `int` produces `int`s in the range from `-size` to `size`.

`Shrinkable<T>` is just a wrapper around a `T` (it has a `value` getter for that). It also has a `shrink` method, which produces an `Iterable` of `Shrinkable<T>` values, which are similar to the current value, but smaller.
Smaller means that if you would call `shrink` repeatedly on the smaller values and their children, grand-children etc., the program should eventually terminate (aka the transitive hull with regard to `shrink` should be finite and acyclic).

The basic types all have corresponding generators implemented. All generators can be found on `any`.

## How to write generators

For simple data classes with some fields, this is how the generator might look like:

```dart
class User {
  final String name;
  final int age;
}

extension AnyUser on Any {
  Generator<User> get user => combine3(any.string, any.int, (name, age) {
    return User(name, age);
  });
}
```

For enums, this is how the generator might look like:

```dart
enum Ripeness { ripe, unripe }

extension AnyRipeness on Any {
  Generator<Ripeness> get ripeness => choose(Ripeness.values);
}
```

If you want to customize generators further, like only generate valid email addresses, you might need to work on a lower level of abstraction.
Just check out the source code of exisitng generators for some examples.

Here's how to set a generator as the default generator for a type:

```dart
Any.setDefault<String>(any.emailAddress);

// Uses the any.emailAddress generator based on the type parameters.
Glados<String>().test('blub', (email) { ... });
```

## Customizing the exploration phase

You can also customize the exploration phase.
To do that, you can use `Explore`, which is a configuration for certain values used during that phase.

For example, if you want to test some code with very big inputs, you might adjust `Explore`'s parameters so that Glados starts with very big inputs and generates much bigger inputs after just a few runs:

```dart
Glados(any.email, Explore(
  initialSize: 100, // Start quite big
  speed: 10,        // and increase the input size by 10 each run,
  numRuns: 10,      // but only do 10 runs instead of 100.
)).test('my test', (input) {
  ...
});
```

`Explore` also has a `random` parameter, which you can provide with a custom `Random` instance.
By default, `Explore` uses a `Random` instance created with a fixed seed so that your tests are deterministic.

## What's up with the name?

GLaDOS is a very nice robot in the Portal game series. She's the head of the Aperture Science Laboratory facilities, where she spends the rest of her days testing. So I thought that's quite a fitting name. ü•î

By the way, both Portal games are great. If you haven't played them, definitely [check them out](https://store.steampowered.com/app/400/Portal/).
